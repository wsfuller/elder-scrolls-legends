# Elder Scrolls Legends

## About Project

[View Demo](https://elder-scrolls-legends.netlify.com/)

The goal of this project is to build a visually appealing, modern responsive front end application. The application connects into the Elder Scrolls Legends API for data retrieval. Users are then able to infinitely scroll through the card data and fuzzy search by card names.

This application was built with React using Create React App. State management and data retrieval with React Hooks. The user interface is built with the React Material UI framework and deployed on Netlify.

### Deployment
